# NYC CitiBike

## Overview
For this assignment, we were given data from the NYC CitiBike offering, which allows residents and visitors to check out a bicycle for transport around the city. The goal of this analysis is to summarize when and by whom the bikes are used for potential expansion in Des Moines, Iowa.

## Results

## Summary
Overall, the CitiBike usage is broad across the NYC areas, specifically Manhattan and Brooklyn. Most often, users who subsribe to the platorm show the highest utilization. It's clear that the riders utilize the bikes to and from work given that the highest utilization and checkout times occur around the start and stop of the work day (Mon-Fri 8a-5p).

In addition to the already completed analysis, I suggest the following be completed before expasion of the service:
  1) Review of the user address or ZIP code to determine where they live vs where they are using the bikes (NYC). This would help us better understand if the users - regardless of user type - are residents or visitors. This could help immensely with marketing in the Des Moines area.
  2) Cost of the bikes purchase and operating costs vs the payments users make for using. While it's clear the bikes are heavily used in the NYC area, there is no guarantee that the bikes are profitable with the current data.
